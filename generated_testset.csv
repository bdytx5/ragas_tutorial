How does the Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts Layer address conditional computation challenges in deep learning?,"['1 Introduction And Related Work 1.1 Conditional Computation\n\nExploiting scale in both training data and model size has been central to the success of deep learning. When datasets are sufficiently large, increasing the capacity (number of parameters) of neural networks can give much better prediction accuracy. This has been shown in domains such as text (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2014; Jozefowicz et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016), images (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Le et al., 2012), and audio (Hinton et al., 2012; Amodei et al., 2015). For typical deep learning models, where the entire model is activated for every example, this leads to a roughly quadratic blow-up in training costs, as both the model size and the number of training examples increase. Unfortunately, the advances in computing power and distributed computation fall short of meeting such demand.\n\nVarious forms of conditional computation have been proposed as a way to increase model capacity without a proportional increase in computational costs (Davis & Arel, 2013; Bengio et al., 2013; Eigen et al., 2013; Ludovic Denoyer, 2014; Cho & Bengio, 2014; Bengio et al., 2015; Almahairi et al., 2015). In these schemes, large parts of a network are active or inactive on a per-example basis. The gating decisions may be binary or sparse and continuous, stochastic or deterministic. Various forms of reinforcement learning and back-propagation are proposed for trarining the gating decisions.\n\nWhile these ideas are promising in theory, no work to date has yet demonstrated massive improvements in model capacity, training time, or model quality. We blame this on a combination of the following challenges:\n\nModern computing devices, especially GPUs, are much faster at arithmetic than at branching. Most of the works above recognize this and propose turning on/off large chunks of the network with each gating decision.\n\nLarge batch sizes are critical for performance, as they amortize the costs of parameter transfers and updates. Conditional computation reduces the batch sizes for the conditionally active chunks of the network.\n\nNetwork bandwidth can be a bottleneck. A cluster of GPUs may have computational power thousands of times greater than the aggregate inter-device network bandwidth. To be computationally efficient, the relative computational versus network demands of an algorithm must exceed this ratio. Embedding layers, which can be seen as a form of conditional computation, are handicapped by this very problem. Since the embeddings generally need to be sent across the network, the number of (example, parameter) interactions is limited by network bandwidth instead of computational capacity.\n\nDepending on the scheme, loss terms may be necessary to achieve the desired level of sparsity per-chunk and/or per example. Bengio et al. (2015) use three such terms. These issues can affect both model quality and load-balancing.\n\nModel capacity is most critical for very large data sets. The existing literature on conditional computation deals with relatively small image recognition data sets consisting of up to 600,000 images. It is hard to imagine that the labels of these images provide a sufficient signal to adequately train a model with millions, let alone billions of parameters. In this work, we for the first time address all of the above challenges and finally realize the promise of conditional computation. We obtain greater than 1000x improvements in model capacity with only minor losses in computational efficiency and significantly advance the state-of-the-art results on public language modeling and translation data sets.\n\n1.2 OUR APPROACH: THE SPARSELY-GATED MIXTURE-OF-EXPERTS LAYER Our approach to conditional computation is to introduce a new type of general purpose neural network component: a Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts Layer (MoE). The MoE consists of a number of experts, each a simple feed-forward neural network, and a trainable gating network which selects a sparse combination of the experts to process each input (see Figure 1). All parts of the network are trained jointly by back-propagation.\n\nWhile the introduced technique is generic, in this paper we focus on language modeling and machine translation tasks, which are known to benefit from very large models. In particular, we apply a MoE convolutionally between stacked LSTM layers (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997), as in Figure 1.\n\nThe MoE is called once for each position in the text, selecting a potentially different combination of experts at each position. The different experts tend to become highly specialized based on syntax and semantics (see Appendix E Table 9). On both language modeling and machine translation benchmarks, we improve on best published results at a fraction of the computational cost.\n\n1.3 Related Work On Mixtures Of Experts\n\nSince its introduction more than two decades ago (Jacobs et al., 1991; Jordan & Jacobs, 1994), the mixture-of-experts approach has been the subject of much research. Different types of expert architectures hae been proposed such as SVMs (Collobert et al., 2002), Gaussian Processes (Tresp, 2001; Theis & Bethge, 2015; Deisenroth & Ng, 2015), Dirichlet Processes (Shahbaba & Neal, 2009), and deep networks. Other work has focused on different expert configurations such as a hierarchical structure (Yao et al., 2009), infinite numbers of experts (Rasmussen & Ghahramani, 2002), and adding experts sequentially (Aljundi et al., 2016). Garmash & Monz (2016) suggest an ensemble model in the format of mixture of experts for machine translation. The gating network is trained on a pre-trained ensemble NMT model. The works above concern top-level mixtures of experts. The mixture of experts is the whole model. Eigen et al. (2013) introduce the idea of using multiple MoEs with their own gating networks as parts of a deep model. It is intuitive that the latter approach is more powerful, since complex problems may contain many sub-problems each requiring different experts. They also allude in their conclusion to the potential to introduce sparsity, turning MoEs into a vehicle for computational computation.\n\nOur work builds on this use of MoEs as a general purpose neural network component. While Eigen et al. (2013) uses two stacked MoEs allowing for two sets of gating decisions, our convolutional application of the MoE allows for different gating decisions at each position in the text. We also realize sparse gating and demonstrate its use as a practical way to massively increase model capacity.\n\n']","The Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts Layer addresses conditional computation challenges in deep learning by introducing a trainable gating network that selects a sparse combination of experts to process each input. This approach allows for increased model capacity without a proportional increase in computational costs, as only a subset of the network is activated for each example. This method improves model capacity significantly while maintaining computational efficiency, particularly in tasks like language modeling and machine translation.",AbstractQuerySynthesizer
How Mixture-of-Experts layer use sparsity and noise in gating network?,"['2 The Structure Of The Mixture-Of-Experts Layer\n\nThe Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layer consists of a set of n ""expert networks"" E1, · · · , En, and a ""gating network"" G whose output is a sparse n-dimensional vector. Figure 1 shows an overview of the MoE module. The experts are themselves neural networks, each with their own parameters.\n\nAlthough in principle we only require that the experts accept the same sized inputs and produce the same-sized outputs, in our initial investigations in this paper, we restrict ourselves to the case where the models are feed-forward networks with identical architectures, but with separate parameters.\n\nLet us denote by G(x) and Ei(x) the output of the gating network and the output of the i-th expert network for a given input x. The output y of the MoE module can be written as follows:\n\n$$y=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}G(x){i}E{i}(x)$$ $$(\\mathbf{l})$$ G(x)iEi(x) (1) We save computation based on the sparsity of the output of G(x). Wherever G(x)i = 0, we need not compute Ei(x). In our experiments, we have up to thousands of experts, but only need to evaluate a handful of them for every example. If the number of experts is very large, we can reduce the branching factor by using a two-level hierarchical MoE. In a hierarchical MoE, a primary gating network chooses a sparse weighted combination of ""experts"", each of which is itself a secondary mixture-of-experts with its own gating network. In the following we focus on ordinary MoEs. We provide more details on hierarchical MoEs in Appendix B. Our implementation is related to other models of conditional computation. A MoE whose experts are simple weight matrices is similar to the parameterized weight matrix proposed in (Cho & Bengio, 2014). A MoE whose experts have one hidden layer is similar to the block-wise dropout described in (Bengio et al., 2015), where the dropped-out layer is sandwiched between fully-activated layers.\n\n2.1 Gating Network\n\nSoftmax Gating: A simple choice of non-sparse gating function (Jordan & Jacobs, 1994) is to multiply the input by a trainable weight matrix Wg and then apply the Sof tmax function.\n\n$$G_{\\sigma}(x)=S o f t m a x(x\\cdot W_{g})$$ $\\eqref{eq:walpha}$. Gσ(x) = Sof tmax(x · Wg) (2) Noisy Top-K Gating: We add two components to the Softmax gating network: sparsity and noise. Before taking the softmax function, we add tunable Gaussian noise, then keep only the top k values, setting the rest to −∞ (which causes the corresponding gate values to equal 0). The sparsity serves to save computation, as described above. While this form of sparsity creates some theoretically scary discontinuities in the output of gating function, we have not yet observed this to be a problem in practice. The noise term helps with load balancing, as will be discussed in Appendix A. The amount of noise per component is controlled by a second trainable weight matrix Wnoise.\n\n$$G(x)=S o f t m a x(K e e p T o p K(H(x),k))$$ $$(4)$$ $$(S)$$ G(x) = Sof tmax(KeepT opK(H(x), k)) (3) $$H(x){i}=(x\\cdot W{g}){i}+S t a n d a r d N o r m a l()\\cdot S o f t p l u s((x\\cdot W{n o i s e}){i})$$ $KeepTopK(v,k){i}=\\begin{cases}v_{i}&\\text{if}v_{i}\\text{is in the top}k\\text{elements of}v.\\ -\\infty&\\text{otherwise.}\\end{cases}$ Training the Gating Network We train the gating network by simple back-propagation, along with the rest of the model. If we choose k > 1, the gate values for the top k experts have nonzero derivatives with respect to the weights of the gating network. This type of occasionally-sensitive behavior is described in (Bengio et al., 2013) with respect to noisy rectifiers. Gradients also backpropagate through the gating network to its inputs. Our method differs here from (Bengio et al., 2015) who use boolean gates and a REINFORCE-style approach to train the gating network.\n\n']","The Mixture-of-Experts layer uses sparsity and noise in the gating network by employing a Noisy Top-K Gating mechanism. This involves adding tunable Gaussian noise before applying the softmax function and keeping only the top k values, setting the rest to −∞, which results in gate values of 0. The sparsity helps save computation by only evaluating a subset of experts, while the noise aids in load balancing.",AbstractQuerySynthesizer
How can shrinking batch problem MoE models be addressed improve computational efficiency?,"[""3 Addressing Performance Challenges 3.1 The Shrinking Batch Problem\n\nOn modern CPUs and GPUs, large batch sizes are necessary for computational efficiency, so as to amortize the overhead of parameter loads and updates. If the gating network chooses k out of n experts for each example, then for a batch of b examples, each expert receives a much smaller batch of approximately kb n b examples. This causes a naive MoE implementation to become very inefficient as the number of experts increases. The solution to this shrinking batch problem is to make the original batch size as large as possible. However, batch size tends to be limited by the memory necessary to store activations between the forwards and backwards passes. We propose the following techniques for increasing the batch size: Mixing Data Parallelism and Model Parallelism: In a conventional distributed training setting, multiple copies of the model on different devices asynchronously process distinct batches of data, and parameters are synchronized through a set of parameter servers. In our technique, these different batches run synchronously so that they can be combined for the MoE layer. We distribute the standard layers of the model and the gating network according to conventional data-parallel schemes, but keep only one shared copy of each expert. Each expert in the MoE layer receives a combined batch consisting of the relevant examples from all of the data-parallel input batches. The same set of devices function as data-parallel replicas (for the standard layers and the gating networks) and as model-parallel shards (each hosting a subset of the experts). If the model is distributed over d devices, and each device processes a batch of size b, each expert receives a batch of approximately kbd nexamples. Thus, we achieve a factor of d improvement in expert batch size.\n\nIn the case of a hierarchical MoE (Section B), the primary gating network employs data parallelism, and the secondary MoEs employ model parallelism. Each secondary MoE resides on one device.\n\nThis technique allows us to increase the number of experts (and hence the number of parameters) by proportionally increasing the number of devices in the training cluster. The total batch size increases, keeping the batch size per expert constant. The memory and bandwidth requirements per device also remain constant, as do the step times, as does the amount of time necessary to process a number of training examples equal to the number of parameters in the model. It is our goal to train a trillionparameter model on a trillion-word corpus. We have not scaled our systems this far as of the writing of this paper, but it should be possible by adding more hardware.\n\nTaking Advantage of Convolutionality: In our language models, we apply the same MoE to each time step of the previous layer. If we wait for the previous layer to finish, we can apply the MoE to all the time steps together as one big batch. Doing so increases the size of the input batch to the MoE layer by a factor of the number of unrolled time steps.\n\nIncreasing Batch Size for a Recurrent MoE: We suspect that even more powerful models may involve applying a MoE recurrently. For example, the weight matrices of a LSTM or other RNN could be replaced by a MoE. Sadly, such models break the convolutional trick from the last paragraph, since the input to the MoE at one timestep depends on the output of the MoE at the previous timestep. Gruslys et al. (2016) describe a technique for drastically reducing the number of stored activations in an unrolled RNN, at the cost of recomputing forward activations. This would allow for a large increase in batch size.\n\n3.2 Network Bandwidth\n\nAnother major performance concern in distributed computing is network bandwidth. Since the experts are stationary (see above) and the number of gating parameters is small, most of the communication involves sending the inputs and outputs of the experts across the network. To maintain computational efficiency, the ratio of an expert's computation to the size of its input and output must exceed the ratio of computational to network capacity of the computing device. For GPUs, this may be thousands to one. In our experiments, we use experts with one hidden layer containing thousands of RELU-activated units. Since the weight matrices in the expert have sizes input_size×hidden_size and hidden_size × output_size, the ratio of computation to input and output is equal to the size of the hidden layer. Conveniently, we can increase computational efficiency simply by using a larger hidden layer, or more hidden layers.\n\n""]","The shrinking batch problem in MoE models can be addressed by making the original batch size as large as possible, mixing data parallelism and model parallelism, and taking advantage of convolutionality.
